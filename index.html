            <p> Creating a list of the best places in a country is always bound to raise some debate when you are
                making the list in a specific order.
                Being in the tourism industry for several years and visiting every corner of the country many times,
                this is what i think is the best place to visit in Bangladesh.
                Let me now in the comments if you agree or disagree with me, and have any suggestion for improvement of
                the list. </p>

        <div class="text2">
            Bisnakandi is located in the Rustampur union of Goainghat Upazila of Sylhet.
            Sylhet’s Goainghat Upazila is filled with mountains, fountains, and greenery. The Upazila has the border with India. The beauty of the places fills the attractions of the tourist. The rocky river, forest, tea orchard in the hills overwhelm the mind! Tourists come to see the beauty of Sylhet’s diversity. At the festival like Eid, these tourist centers are crowded.

           As like Jaflong, Bisnakandi is a place where the river is filled with the stone. It makes the surrounding enchanting. However, due to the uncontrolled stone lifting, the beauty of Jaflong is on the verge of destruction today, but the Bisnakandi retains its youth.
        Many of the steps of the Khasia Hills on the Bangladesh-India border have come from one side to the other, and the hills have the highest springs of Meghalaya in India. The main attraction of the Bisnakandi to the tourists is the transparent water stream that flows over the rocks and the whirlwind of white clouds over the mountains. At first, you will feel like a stone bed, and the calmness that you get in the clear water will bring you the peace of mind again and again. It is as though the mountains, rivers, fountains, and rocks have laid the natural bedding in Bisnakandi.
